# Hello Friend Portfolio

Welcome to my playful and interactive portfolio! This project is built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a unique design that allows users to switch between light and dark modes with a single click. The centerpiece of the portfolio is an animated cat that changes its behavior depending on the modeâ€”sleeping during the day and waking up at night.

## Features

- **Interactive Design**: Click on the cat to toggle between light and dark modes.
- **Responsive Layout**: The portfolio is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Simple and Clean Code**: The project is structured using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Development Setup

To get started with the development, I recommend using the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code. This plugin allows you to launch a local development server with live reload, so you can see your changes in real-time as you code.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hello-friend-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.

3. Install the **Live Server** extension if you haven't already.

4. Right-click on `index.html` and select `Open with Live Server`.

5. Your default browser will open, and you'll be able to see the portfolio live. Any changes you make in the code will automatically refresh the page.
